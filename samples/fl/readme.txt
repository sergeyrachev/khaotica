This folder contains the Flavor source files for the samples.  
It also includes the GIF87a spec ('gif87a.txt') so that the Flavor description
of the GIF87a bitstream specification ('gifprint.fl' and 'gif87a.fl') can be 
checked.

The 'others' directory contains other Flavor descriptions of some of the 
popular bitstream specifications, which are not used by the samples.
