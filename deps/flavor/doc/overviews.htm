<h1>Overview of Flavor</h1>


<h2><a name="overview">Overview Documents</a></h2>

<p>
As the design of Flavor progressed starting from its initial design in November 1995, we have 
produced a number of documents that describe its architecture and functionality as well as 
analyze its performance.  As a result of the evolution of the language, some of these documents 
only have historic interest, as they no longer accurately reflect the latest specification.  In 
many respects, however, the actual differences are rather minor.
</p>

<p>
In the following we only provide documents that we considered helpful (and the most up-to-date) in 
getting started with the Version 5.1 implementation.  If you are interested in other publications, 
please visit the Flavor web site at <a target="_blank" href="http://flavor.sourceforge.net">

  <dt><a name="flavor"><strong>Flavor: A Language for Media Representation</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>This is a modified version of the paper (with the same title) published in the proceedings
      of the ACM Multimedia 1997 conference.  This paper incorporates all enhancements/extensions
      applied to the current version of Flavor.  This is probably the best overview document
      available.<br><br>
     
      The paper is available in the Adobe Acrobat <a href="papers/flavor.pdf">PDF</a> format.</dd>

  <dt><b><a name="map">Automatic Generation of Entropy Coding Programs using Flavor</a></b></dt>
  <dd>This is a paper presented at the IEEE Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing in
      December 1998. It describes the rationale as well as the actual implementation of 
      variable length code (VLC) tables in Flavor.<br><br>
      
      The paper is available in the Adobe Acrobat <a href="papers/map.pdf">PDF</a> format.<br><br>

      Though the above paper describes the current implementation of the Flavor translator,
      we have devised a more efficient method for VLC decoding and this is described in
      a <a href="papers/partitioning.pdf">paper</a> submitted to the IEEE Transactions on 
      Circuits and Systems for Video Technology.  We are currently working on this 
      implementation.</dd>

  <dt><b><a name="bac">Automatic Generation of C++/Java Code for Efficient Binary Arithmetic Coding</a></b></dt>
  <dd>This is a paper submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video
      Technology.  It describes, in detail, the <code>bac</code> construct that is used for
      "formally" specifying binary arithmetic coders (BACs).  The construct is comprised of 
      a number of parameters so that a wide variety of coders can be specified.  It can 
      be used to specified any one of the currently deployed BACs such as the ones used in 
      JPEG, JPEG2000 and H.264.  The paper also describes a very efficient semi-quasi-renormalization 
      method that is shown to be faster than the currently deployed renormalization methods.  
      This is the best overview document for the <code>bac</code> construct.<br><br>
      
      The paper is available in the Adobe Acrobat <a href="papers/bac.pdf">PDF</a> format.</dd>

  <dt><b><a name="xflavor">XFlavor: Providing XML Features in Media Representation</a></b></dt>
  <dd>This is the description of the XML features added to the Flavor translator.  The 
      paper has been submitted to the Multimedia Tools and Applications journal.<br><br>

      The paper is available in the Adobe Acrobat <a href="papers/xflavor.pdf">PDF</a> format.</dd>
