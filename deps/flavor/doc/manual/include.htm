<h3>7. Include/Import Directives</h3>

<p>
In order to simplify the source code organization, Flavor now supports <code>%include</code> and
<code>%import</code> directives. These are the mechanisms to combine several different source code
files into one entity, or to share a given data structure definition across different projects.
</p> 


<h4><a name="include">7.1 Include Directive</a></h4>

<p>
The statement <code>%include "file"</code> will include <code>file</code> in the current position
and will flag all of the file's content so that no code is generated. A C++ <code>%include</code> 
statement for the <code>.h</code> file corresponding to the included Flavor file will be placed at 
the same place in the <code>.h</code> file of the currently processed Flavor file.
</p>

<p>
The following is an example.
</p>

<table border="0" width="100%" class="Example">
<tr><td width="100%"><code>
<pre>// In the file, included.fl
const int a = 4;

// In the file, main.fl
%include &quot;included.fl&quot;

class Test {
    int(a) t;   // 'a' is included from the included.fl file
}</pre>
</code></td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The file <code>main.fl</code> includes the file <code>included.fl</code>, which contains the definition
of the constant <code>a</code>. Inclusion makes the declaration of the <code>a</code> variable available
to the <code>main.fl</code> file. In terms of the generated output, the following outlines the placement
of information in different files.
</p>

<table border="0" width="100%" class="Example">
<tr><td width="100%"><code>
<pre>// In the file, included.h
extern const int a;

// In the file, included.cpp
#include &quot;included.h&quot;
const int a = 4;

// In the file, main.h
#include &quot;main.h&quot;
#include &quot;included.h&quot;
...</pre>
</code></td></tr>
</table>

<p>
We see here that the main and included files each keep their corresponding implementations. The 
generated C++ code maintains this partitioning, and makes sure that the main file includes the C++
header file of the included Flavor file.
</p>

<p>
The <code>%include</code> directive is useful when data structures need to be shared across modules or
projects. It is similar in spirit to the use of the C/C++ preprocessor <code>#include</code> statement
in the sense that it is used to make general information available at several different places in a 
program. Its operation, however, is different as Flavor's <code>%include</code> does not involve code
generation for the included code. In C/C++, <code>%include</code> is equivalent to copying the included
file in the position of the <code>#include</code> statement. This behavior is offered in Flavor by the
<code>%import</code> directive.
</p>


<h4><a name="import">7.2 Import Directive</a></h4>

<p>
The <code>%import</code> directive behaves similarly to the <code>%include</code> directive, except that
full code is generated for the imported file by the translator, and no C++ <code>#include</code>
statement is used. This behavior is identical to how a C++ preprocesor <code>#include</code> statement
would behave in Flavor.
</p>

<p>
Let's consider the example of the previous section, this time with an <code>%import</code> directive
rather than an <code>%include</code> one.
</p>

<table border="0" width="100%" class="Example">
<tr><td width="100%"><code>
<pre>// In the file, imported.fl
const int a = 4;

// In the file, main.fl
%import &quot;imported.fl&quot;

class Test {
    int(a) t;   // 'a' is included from the imported.fl file
}</pre>
</code></td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Note that the Jave <code>import</code> statement behaves more like Flavor's <code>%include</code> 
statement, in that no code generation takes place for the imported (included) code.
</p>


<h4><a name="notes">7.3 Notes on Inclusion</a></h4>

<p>
The <code>%include</code> and <code>%import</code> directives can greatly simplify the structure of 
the Flavor source code. When more than one level of inclusion or importing is present, care must be 
taken to ensure that the programmer obtains the desired behavior.
</p>

<p>
For a series of nested includes/imports, a file is treated as imported if and only if all the previous
files were imported as well (rather than just be included). This means that an include inside an import
shows up as an include in the top-most file. However, an include inside and include does not show up at
the top file at all.
</p>

<p>
Another issue with included or imported files is that the <code>lengthof</code> and <code>isidof</code>
operators as well as polymorthism will break if they happen across different files. If you extend a 
polymorphic class in a different <code>.fl</code> file from the base class, you <em>must</em> make sure
that the <code>.fl</code> file of the derived class is included in the <code>.fl</code> file of the
base class. This will ensure that the entire range of IDs will be accessible to both <code>.fl</code>
files.
</p>

<p>
Similary, <code>lengthof()</code> is not generated automatically for all variables, but is flagged for
generation when the translator encounters it. If this flagging is not done in the current run of the 
translator, then the needed code will <em>not</em> be generated. Again, the solution is to cross-include
the files.
</p>

<p>
The cross-inclusion creates looped includes. The translator detects them and avoids them. Detection is
based on the base name of the included/imported file (the name of the file without the directory
specification). This means that the files with the same name but in different directories cannot be
differenciated. Also note that the comparison is case sensitive in UNIX platforms, but case 
insensitive for Win32 platforms. Cross-inclusion carries over to the generated code. For C++ modules, 
the translator generates <code>ifndef/endif</code> statements that avoid duplicate inclusion at the
C++ level.
</p>

<p>
The translator can optionally issue a warning message for looped <code>include</code>/<code>import</code> 
directives (see the <a href="options.htm">Command Line Options</a> section). Normally they are not 
reported because they are considered normal.
</p>

<p>
The behavior of <code>%pragma</code> statements is also affected by <code>include</code>/<code>import</code>
directives. The same rules of inclusion apply here as well: pragmas in an included file are not 
effective on the parent file (they are ignored), whereas pragmas on an imported file are effective 
on the parent file.
