<h3><strong>6. Scoping Rules</strong></h3>

<p>
The scoping rules that Flavor uses are identical with C++ and Java, with the exception of parsable variables.
</p>

<p>
As in C++ and Java, a new scope is introduced with curly braces (<code>{}</code>). Since Flavor does not have 
functions or methods, a scope can either be the global one or a scope within a class declaration.
</p>

<p>
The global scope cannot contain any parsable variable, since it does not belong to any object. As a result, global 
variables can only be constants.
</p>

<p>
Within a class, all parsable variables are considered as class member variables, regardless of the scope they are 
encountered in. This is essential in order to allow conditional declarations of variables which will almost always 
require that the actual declarations occur within compound statements. Non-parsable variables that occur in the
top-most class scope are also considered class member variables. The rest live within their individual scopes.
</p>

<p>
This distinction is important in order to understand which variables are accessible to a class variable that is 
contained in another class. The issues are illustrated in the following example.
</p>

<table border="0" width="100%" class="Example">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><pre><code>class A {
    int i = 1;
    int(2) a;
    if (a == 2) {
        int j = i;    
        int i = 2; // hides i, ok
        int a;     // hides a, error
    } 
}
    
class B {
    A a;
    a.j = 1;       // error, j not in a
    int j = a.a+1; // ok
    j = a.i+2;     // ok
    int(3) b;
}</code></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Looking at class <code>A</code>, the initial declaration of <code>i</code> occurs in
the top-most class scope; as a result <code>i</code> is a class member. The variable <code>a</code> 
is declared as a parsable variable, and hence it is automatically a class member variable.
The declaration of <code>j</code> occurs in the scope enclosed by the <code>if</code>
statement; as this is not the top-level scope, <code>j</code> is not a class member. The
following declaration of <code>i</code> is acceptable; the original one is hidden within
that scope. Finally, the declaration of the variable <code>a</code> as a non-parsable
would hide the parsable version. As parsable variables do not obey scoping rules, this is
not allowed (hiding parsable variables of a base class, however, is allowed).
</p>

<p>
Looking now at the declaration of class <code>B</code> which contains a variable of
type <code>A</code>, it becomes clear which variables are available as class members.
</p>

<p>
Variables that have as their type a forward-declared class are considered parsable,
regardless if the actual definition turns out to be parsable or not.
</p>

<p>
In summary, the scoping rules have the following two special considerations. Parsable
variables do not obey scoping rules and are always considered class members. Non-parsable
variables obey the standard scoping rules and are considered class members only if they are
at the top-level scope of the class.
</p>

<p>
Note that parameter type variables are considered as having the top-level scope of the
class. Also, they are not allowed to hide the object identifier, if any.
