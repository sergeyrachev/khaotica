<h3><strong>1. General</strong></h3>


<h4><a name="literals">1.1 Literals</a></h4>

<p>
All traditional C++ and Java literals are supported by Flavor. This includes integers, 
floating-point numbers and character constants (e.g., '<code>a</code>').  Additionally, Flavor 
defines a special binary number notation using the prefix <code>0b</code>.  In addition to 
specifying the actual value, binary literals (bit strings) also convey their length.  For
example, one can write <code>0b011</code> to denote the number 3 represented using 3 bits.  For
readability, a bit string can include periods every four digits, e.g., <code>0b0010.01</code>.  
Hexadecimal or octal constants used in the context of a bitstring also convey their length in 
addition to their value.  Whenever the length of a bitstring literal is irrelevant, it is 
treated as a regular integer literal.
</p>

<p>
Strings are also supported by Flavor.  They are converted to arrays of characters, with or 
without a trailing '<code>\0</code>' (null).  Users can control this using the <code>-s</code> 
<a href="../manual/options.htm#nullstring">command line option</a> or the corresponding 
nullstrings/nonullstrings <a href="../manual/pragma.htm">pragma statement</a>.
</p>


<h4><a name="comments">1.2 Comments</a></h4>

<p>
Both multi-line (/**/) and single-line (//) comments are allowed.  Multi-line comment delimiters 
cannot be nested.
</p>


<h4><a name="names">1.3 Names</a></h4>

<p>
Variable names follow the C++ and Java conventions (i.e., variable names must start with a letter 
or an underscore).  The keywords that are used in C++ and Java are considered reserved in Flavor.
</p>


<h4><a name="types">1.4 Built-In Types</a></h4>

<p>
Flavor supports the common subset of C++ and Java built-in or fundamental types.  This includes 
<code>char</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, and <code>double</code> along with all
appropriate modifiers (<code>short</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>signed</code>, 
<code>unsigned</code>). In addition, Flavor defines a new type called <code>bit</code> and a set
of new modifiers (<code>big</code> and <code>little</code>).
</p>

<p>
The type <code>bit</code> is to accommodate bits tring variables (e.g. "<code>bit(3) value = 
0b101;</code>").
</p>

<p>
The modifiers, <code>big</code> and <code>little</code> can be used to indicate the byte ordering 
of the numbers in bitstream.  The <code>big</code> modifier is used to represent the numbers 
using big-endian byte ordering (the most significan byte first) and the <code>little</code> 
modifier is used for the numbers represented using the little-endian or reverse byte ordering. 
By default, big-endian byte ordering is assumed.
</p>

<p>
Arrays of the built-in types are also supprted.  Arrays of Flavor have special behavior due to 
its declarative nature.  Arrays can be declared as parsable and also partially - partial arrays. 
For detailed syntax and semantics of arrays please refer to <a href="arrays.htm">Arrays and 
Partial Arrays</a>.
</p>

<p>
Flavor does not support pointers, references, casts, or C++ operators related to pointers.  It 
also does not support structures or enumerations.
</p>


<h4><a name="usertype">1.5 User-Defined Types</a></h4>

<p>
Flavor allows the declaration of new types in the form of classes (see <a href="classes.htm">
Classes</a>).
</p>

<p>
From Version 4.0 of the translator, <code>map</code> is supported.  Maps are used to define constant- 
or variable-length mappings between bitstream values and object variables (See <a href="maps.htm">
Maps</a> for more information).
