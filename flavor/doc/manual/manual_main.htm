<h1>Flavor Translator (<em>flavorc</em>) Version 5.1 User's Manual</h1>

<p>
This document describes the features of the Flavor translator (<code>flavorc</code>)
as well as how to use the translator-generated code within your own C++ and Java programs.  
Its purpose is not to describe the Flavor language itself, but rather the programming 
environment in which the generated code operates.  It is best that you are already
familiar with the basic syntax and structure of Flavor (see the <a target="_blank" 
href="../spec/spec.htm">Flavor specification</a>).  Even without any prior knowledge 
of Flavor, however, you should be able to follow the text without any problem.
</p>

<p>
Several examples will be shown to demonstrate the operation of the software; it is 
advisable to run and test some or all of these examples in your own platform/environment.
</p>

The contents of this document are as follows:

<dl> 
  <dt><a href="flavor.htm"><strong>Section 1: Using Flavor with C++ and Java</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>This is a detailed description of how code generated by the Flavor translator 
      interfaces with C++ and Java.  We use very simple Flavor representations based 
      on plain text files so that emphasis is placed on the generated code rather 
      than the Flavor side.  In the process, most of Flavor's syntactic features are 
      gradually introduced.  This can also serve as an introduction to Flavor itself, 
      albeit a limited one: issues like scoping rules or maps are not discussed as 
      they do not affect C++ or Java programming in any way.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  
  <dt><a href="xflavor.htm"><strong>Section 2: Using XFlavor</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>This is a detailed description of how the translator's XML features can be
      used.  The examples in the previous section are used again, thus resulting
      in a simple XML representation of the Flavor described data.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  
  <dt><a href="options.htm"><strong>Section 3: Command Line Options</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Here we describe the various command line options and their effects.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  
  <dt><a href="verbatim.htm"><strong>Section 4: Verbatim Code</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Verbatim code is a mechanism allowing a programmer to insert C++ or Java code
      in the Flavor source code.  We describe how to fully utilize this feature in
      order to integrate Flavor and C++ or Java code in the same file.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
 
  <dt><a href="pragma.htm"><strong>Section 5: Pragma Statements</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>The syntax and use of pragma statements are described.  Pragma statement 
      is a mechanism to trigger options setting to the translator from the Flavor
      source code (similar to pragma statements of a C or C++ preprocessor).</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  
  <dt><a href="tracing.htm"><strong>Section 6: Tracing</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Description of tracing and the format of the trace dump are provided.</dd>
  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
  
  <dt><a href="include.htm"><strong>Section 7: Include/Import Directives</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>These are the mechanisms to combine several different source code files into
      one entity, or to share a given data structure definition across different
      projects.</dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  
  <dt><a href="rtl.htm"><strong>Section 8: Run-Time Library</strong></a></dt>
  <dd>Description of the various interfaces used by the translator -- including 
      bitstream I/O, tracing, and error reporting -- is provided for C++ and Java.</dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>

We made every possible effort to ensure that the document is complete and without errors. 
We also tried to make it as brief as possible, to ensure that you get all the necessary
information quickly and can be up and running with your own code as soon as possible. 
Should you find any problems with the software or the documentation, we would 
appreciate your <a href="mailto:danny@ee.columbia.edu">feedback</a>.
